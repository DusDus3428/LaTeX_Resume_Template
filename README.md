# Resume_Template

Creating a good résumé these days is very important. With the amount of applications a hiring manager or recruiter recieves it's no wonder that they can only spend a few seconds in order to determine if you could be a fit.
So it is very important that your résumé stands out from the rest.

Because of this, I decided to create my résumé with LaTeX, a tool heavly used in academia, especially within the mathematics and science sectors. Similar to HTML/CSS, you can create your document using a .tex file, and you can style it with a .cls file.

This repository offers you a template for a résumé that I created using LaTeX. Feel free to fork or download this template and I encourage you to personalize it so that it really reflects who you are (I forked it myself in a private repo in order to do that).

## Seting up LaTeX for Windows and generating the PDF

1. Download and install MikTeX from here: https://miktex.org/download
2. Download and install TexMaker from here: https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html
3. Open the resume_template.tex file in TexMaker
4. Click on Quick Build
5. Now you should be able to see the generated PDF file in the PDF viewer

If you cannot see the generated PDF file automatically after clicking on Quick Build, then click on the PDF Viewer tab at the bottom left corner.
You can also find your PDF file in your local repository folder.

## My Sources

I used this guide for my own setup: http://educ.jmu.edu/~arnoldea/latex_setup_and_tutorial.htm.
I created this template using this guide here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TRcPIPkZz8 (the presenter does not go into great detail about how LaTeX works)

## Things to Configure

* Change the foto to a professional image of yourself
* Change the font if you like. I personally used this website for that purpose: https://tug.org/FontCatalogue/sansseriffonts.html
* Personalize the design. As mentioned above, even I created a private fork of this repository in order to adjust the design to represent me. I would not use this vanilla template for my resume.
